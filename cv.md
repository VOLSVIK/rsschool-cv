### **About myself**
My desire to learn has 2 goals:
1.  get an opportunity to find a job in Poland as a programmer.
2.  the realization of the idea of photography using the ability to upload and store photos, as well as their evaluation and selection for clients, with the involvement of their friends and interested people. My attempts to implement the idea in the WordPress system did not give the expected result, but the desire to do this does not leave me.
